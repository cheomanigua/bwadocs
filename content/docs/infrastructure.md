## General

```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group firebase(cloud)[Firebase]
    service db(database)[Firestore] in firebase
    service host(server)[Hosting] in firebase
    service auth(server)[Authentication] in firebase
    group cloudrun(cloud)[Cloud Run]
    service goapi(server)[Go API] in cloudrun
    group gcs(cloud)[Cloud Storage]
    service buc(disk)[Bucket] in gcs
```

### Services in Production

-   **Firebase Hosting**: Static site frontend (unrestricted pages).
-   **Cloud Storage**: Static site frontend (restricted pages).
-   **Cloud Run**: Go API backend.
-   **Firebase Authentication**: User’s login/logout management, credentials storage.
-   **Firestore**: User’s profile database.
-   **Stripe**: Payment and billing platform.

### Development Infraestructure

In order to simulate the services in production, the development infraestructure uses one local computer with four containers running locally in the computer:

-   **Hugo** static website generator is installed baremetal in the computer.
-   **Caddy** reverse proxy is running in one container (simulates Firebase Hosting)
    -   Port: 5000
-   **Firebase Emulator** is running in another container (simulates Auth and Firestore).
    -   Ports: 4000, 8080 and 9099
-   **GCS Fake Server** is running in another container (simulates GCS Bucket).
    -   Port: 9000
-   **Go API server** is running in another container (simulates Cloud Run).
    -   Port: 8081

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Local development with Firebase Emulator Suite comes with a big limitation: **no support for rewrites** in `firebase.json`. For this reason **Caddy** reverse proxy is used instead of Firebase Hosting in the local development environment.

### Production workflow

-   Changes in development are pushed to GitHub, which triggers GitHub actions.
-   Github action runs Hugo static site generator and deploys public directory to **Firebase**.
-   Github actions runs Cloud Build, pushes image to Artifact Registry and deploys to **Cloud Run**.

## Dev vs Prod


Area

Firebase Emulator (localhost)

Production Firebase + GCP

What breaks / changes in prod

1

Authentication

`FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST="localhost:9099"` → unlimited users, no email verification, no rate limits

Real users, email verification, password policies, reCAPTCHA, blocked abusive IPs, rate limits

Email verification required, sign-in can be blocked

2

Firestore Data

Data lives only in RAM or local files → disappears on shutdown/restart

Data is permanent, global, eventually consistent, billed per read/write/delete

You pay for every operation, data survives forever

3

Firestore Security Rules

**Completely ignored** unless you explicitly run `firebase emulators:start --only firestore,auth` with rules

Enforced on every read/write → will reject requests even if your Go Admin SDK bypasses them for client SDKs

Your frontend will 403 if rules are wrong

4

Firebase Admin SDK

Works normally (you use `option.WithoutAuthentication()` or service account)

In Cloud Run you **must** use Application Default Credentials or service account key

No `WithoutAuthentication()` in prod

5

Stripe Webhooks

You cannot hit `localhost` from Stripe → you need ngrok/tunnel or `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8081`

Stripe hits your real Cloud Run URL directly

Webhook endpoint must be public + HTTPS

6

Cloud Run URLs

`http://localhost:8081`

`https://your-service-abc123-uc.a.run.app`

CORS, HTTPS, IAP if private

7

Billing & Quotas

Unlimited everything for free

Hard quotas + costs: reads, writes, storage, Auth users, Hosting bandwidth, etc.

You will hit limits and get billed

8

Latency & Consistency

Instant (<5 ms)

50–400 ms depending on region + eventual consistency

Slower, occasional stale reads

9

Functions Triggers

`functions`, `firestore`, `auth` triggers work locally

Real Cloud Functions or Cloud Run triggered by events

Different URLs, cold starts

10

Hosting + Custom Domains

Only serves on `localhost:5000`

Real custom domain + SSL + CDN

Real SEO, real performance

11

Identity Platform Features

Not emulated (phone auth, SAML, OIDC, blocking functions)

Available in prod (extra cost)

Features missing locally

12

Service Account Permissions

You can use any service account JSON

In GCP the Cloud Run service account must have exact roles (Firestore, Auth Admin, etc.)

IAM errors if roles missing

13

Logging & Monitoring

`firebase emulators:start` prints to console

Cloud Logging, Error Reporting, Tracing

Different debugging experience

### Quick checklist: “Will it work the same in production?”

Feature

Works identically?

Notes

`authClient.VerifyIDToken()`

Yes

Same code

`firestoreClient.Get/Set` with Admin SDK

Yes

Same code

Registration flow (your Go API)

Yes

Same code

Stripe Checkout Session creation

Yes

Same code

Stripe webhooks

No

Must use real endpoint or CLI forwarding

Firestore Security Rules

No

Ignored locally

Email verification / password reset

No

Not emulated

Rate limiting / abuse protection

No

No limits locally

Costs

No

$0 vs real money

### Bottom line you feel every day

| Local emulator → great for 95 % of development (fast, free, offline)
| Production → you suddenly pay, hit quotas, deal with webhooks, security rules, IAM, and real users

Keep developing 100 % against the emulator, but **always do a final test on a real staging project** before releasing — especially Stripe webhooks, security rules, and IAM are the three things that most commonly break when you go live.

### Files develop vs prod

Here’s the **exact list of Firebase-related files/configs** that behave differently or can bite you when you switch from **emulators** to **real production** — and what you must check/adapt in each one.

File / Config

What it contains

Emulator vs Production difference

What you MUST change or double-check before going live

`firebase.json`

Hosting config, rewrites, emulator ports, functions triggers

In dev you often have `rewrites` to localhost or emulator ports

Remove or comment out any `rewrites` that point to `localhost` or emulator ports

`.firebaserc`

Mapping of local aliases → real Firebase project IDs (`default`, `staging`, `prod`)

`firebase use dev` → points to your emulator project; `firebase use prod` → real project

Make sure `firebase use prod` (or `--project your-prod-id`) is active before deploy

`firestore.rules`

Security rules

Completely ignored by emulator unless you start it with `--only firestore`; always enforced in prod

Test them locally with `firebase emulators:start --only firestore` + real client SDK (not Admin SDK)

`firestore.indexes.json`

Composite indexes

Works the same, but you forget to deploy them → queries fail in prod

Always run `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes` after adding new ones

`storage.rules`

Storage security rules (if you use Firebase Storage)

Same story as Firestore rules — ignored locally unless emulated

Deploy + test with real client SDK

`functions/.env` or `functions/.runtimeconfig`

Environment variables for Cloud Functions (if you have any)

Often contain `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=test_...`, `IS_EMULATOR=true`, etc.

Switch to live Stripe keys, remove emulator flags

`src/firebaseConfig.ts` or `src/firebase.js` (web)

`firebase.initializeApp({ apiKey, authDomain, projectId, ... })`

Dev version usually points to `localhost` or dev project (`projectId: "demo-dev"`)

Change `projectId`, `authDomain`, `apiKey` to production values

Service account JSON (for Go backend)

`google-credentials.json` or ADC in Cloud Run

In dev you often use `option.WithCredentialsFile("dev-service-account.json")` or `WithoutAuthentication()`

In production Cloud Run → **delete** `WithoutAuthentication()` and rely on ADC (default service account)

Go environment variables

`FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST`, `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST`

Set in dev → must be **absent** in production

Remove these two env vars completely in prod

`stripe webhook secret`

Hard-coded or in `.env`

Dev: test webhook secret `whsec_test_...`; Prod: live secret `whsec_...`

Use different secrets per environment

`functions/index.js` or Cloud Run code

Any `process.env.IS_EMULATOR` checks

Often used to skip email verification, etc.

Remove or guard those blocks for production

### Minimal checklist you run before every production deploy

```bash
# 1. Switch project
firebase use prod        # or --project your-real-project-id

# 2. Remove emulator env vars (Go backend)
unset FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST
unset FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST

# 3. Deploy everything that can be forgotten
firebase deploy --only hosting,firestore:rules,firestore:indexes,functions

# 4. Verify in browser console
#    firebase.app().name → should show your real project ID, not "demo-dev" or "__emulator__"

# 5. Test one real login + one protected API call
# 6. Test one Stripe test → live mode switch (if you have separate test/live projects)
```

Keep the dev versions of these files in a separate branch or `.env.dev` — never commit production secrets or `WithoutAuthentication()` to main.
Do these steps and your switch from emulator → production will be painless every single time.
